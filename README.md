# Alfred: Personal Assistant [for Android]

(aka: "If Mark Zuckerberg can attempt to do it, then why can't I?")

On 2016/01/03 MZ announced (via https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102577175875681):  
"My personal challenge for 2016 is to build a simple AI to run my home and help me with my work. You can think of it kind of like Jarvis in Iron Man."

Meh! There seems to be very little specifics here, and I am skeptical that his effort(s)/progress will be publicized much along the way.

I've had an itch to do this for years, and in 2014/09 I [very] briefly started something:

* https://github.com/swooby/pocketsphinx-android
* https://github.com/swooby/pocketsphinx-android-demo

Personal issues [some of the worst I have ever been through] quickly interrupted those plans.  
Those plans were to take place along several fronts:

1. Obviously, "The Actual End Product App" that everyone sees
2. The hardware needed to make TAEPA work
3. The supporting software libraries to make TAEPA work

I've been working on these subconsciously over the past few years,  
and the past year has been a stealth attempt to work on #2 and #3.

This repo is my new revived attempt at trying this, with MZ as inspiration.

Heck, maybe I can follow along w/ him and learn something.  
Heck, maybe he will find this project and learn from from me! :)
